This repository (also a dat archive! see below) is an index of "early days"
(say the first year or two) of dat archives. These archives (say, up to a few
thousand or a few hundred gigabytes total) will be preserved by the Internet
Archive (archive.org).

Of particular interest are early experiments, tests, demos, and creative
content.
